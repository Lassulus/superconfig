  # NetworkManager is the sole wifi manager on NM hosts. The base

  # 40-<iface>.network. Two DHCP clients on one link fight over the lease and
  # routes and drop the connection every few minutes (networkd logged a
  # "DHCP lease lost"/"acquired" cycle on the wifi every ~10-20 min). Match
  # by Type=wlan (not interface name) and sort before 40-* so networkd leaves
  # every wifi link to NetworkManager, immune to the wlp192s0<->wlan0 rename.
