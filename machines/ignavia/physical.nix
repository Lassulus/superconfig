  # 1. NVMe defaults to scheduler "none" (FIFO, no read/write fairness), so a
  #    read queues behind up to nr_requests (1023) writes. mq-deadline gives

  #    hard on 62 GB RAM. Writes pool in RAM then flush in multi-GB bursts that

  # MT7925 wifi stability. The dominant cause of the "drops every few
  # minutes" was a dual-manager conflict (systemd-networkd AND NM both
  # running DHCP on the wifi) - fixed in 2configs/network-manager.nix by
  # handing wifi solely to NM. The remainder below addresses a *separate*,
  # secondary mt7925 firmware bug: the card intermittently tears the link
  # down during scans (wpa_supplicant "reason=3 locally_generated=1" next
  # to "Reject scan trigger since one is already pending"; iwd shows it
  # mid-roam) - a driver bug with no fix below the kernel. We need
  # aggressive roaming (event with ~100 APs) so we cannot disable the scans
  # that trigger it; we only cut how often it fires. When it does fire, NM
  # re-associates on its own in a few seconds (a gateway-ping watchdog was
  # tried and removed: bornhack's gateway drops ICMP, so it false-fired and
  # bounced a working link every 90 s).
  #
  # 1. Stay on the default wpa_supplicant backend. iwd roams well but
  #    busy-loops at 100% CPU in this dense ~100-AP environment (it chokes
  #    on the flood of HE-capability beacons) and wedged the link hard
  #    enough to need a driver reload - not usable here.
  #
  # 2. Kill NIC power management. powersave and PCIe ASPM both let the
  #    firmware abort/miss a scan mid-connection on this chip; disabling
  #    both is the most-reported mt7925 stability mitigation.
