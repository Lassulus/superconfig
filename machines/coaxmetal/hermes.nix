      # herdr

      `herdr` on this host is a wrapper that talks to lass's running herdr
      server (the agent multiplexer holding the coding-agent panes). Every
      invocation prints JSON.

      Use it whenever the user asks about "the agents", "the herd", "the
      session on herdr", what something is "stuck on", or wants a prompt or
      answer delivered to a running agent.

      | Command | Use |
      | --- | --- |
      | `herdr agent list` | Every agent with its state: working, blocked, idle, done. Start here. |
      | `herdr agent get <agent>` | One agent's detail (workspace, tab, pane, cwd). |
      | `herdr agent read <agent>` | Recent terminal output. This is how you answer "what is it doing/asking". |
      | `herdr agent prompt <agent> '<text>'` | Submit a prompt to that agent, e.g. to unblock an approval. |
      | `herdr agent wait <agent> --state idle` | Block until it reaches a state. |
      | `herdr workspace list` / `herdr tab list` / `herdr pane list` | Structure, when agent-level views are not enough. |
      | `herdr --skill` | herdr's own, fuller usage reference — read it before improvising flags. |

      Answering by voice: the reply is spoken, so summarize what `agent read`
      shows in a sentence or two instead of reciting scrollback, and say the
      agent's name and state first. Read a diff or a stack trace aloud only if
      asked.

      Blocked agents are the interesting case: report what the agent is waiting
      for, and only run `herdr agent prompt` when the user actually decides.
      Never close panes or kill agents on your own.

      # calendar

      lass has exactly one calendar, at `$CALDAV_CALENDAR_URL`
      (CalDAV on radicale). It holds his own events, booking requests and
      bookings from https://book.lassul.us, and events you add. The booking
      page treats every event in it as busy time.

      Use it when the user asks what is on his schedule, whether he is free,
      to add, move or remove an appointment, or about booking requests.

      Authenticate every request with
      `curl -sS -u "$CALDAV_USER:$CALDAV_PASSWORD"`. Never print, echo or
      repeat the password. Times are Europe/Berlin unless the user says
      otherwise; write DTSTART/DTEND with `;TZID=Europe/Berlin` or in UTC (`Z`).

      ## Reading

      Events overlapping a range (UTC, `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`):

      ```sh
      curl -sS -u "$CALDAV_USER:$CALDAV_PASSWORD" -X REPORT -H 'Depth: 1' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8' "$CALDAV_CALENDAR_URL" --data '
      <C:calendar-query xmlns:D="DAV:" xmlns:C="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav">
        <D:prop><D:getetag/><C:calendar-data/></D:prop>
        <C:filter><C:comp-filter name="VCALENDAR"><C:comp-filter name="VEVENT">
          <C:time-range start="20261010T000000Z" end="20261017T000000Z"/>
        </C:comp-filter></C:comp-filter></C:filter>
      </C:calendar-query>'
      ```

      Each `<D:response>` has the event's `href` (its URL path), `getetag` and
      the iCalendar text. Recurring events (RRULE) come back once with their
      rule; expand them yourself when answering "what is on Tuesday".

      ## Adding, changing, removing your own events

      - Add: pick a UID (`uuidgen`-style, suffix `@hermes`), then
        `PUT "$CALDAV_CALENDAR_URL<uid>.ics"` with
        `-H 'Content-Type: text/calendar; charset=utf-8' -H 'If-None-Match: *'`
        and a body of one `VCALENDAR` (VERSION:2.0, PRODID) holding one
        `VEVENT` with UID, DTSTAMP, DTSTART, DTEND (or DURATION) and SUMMARY.
        Add a `VALARM` (ACTION:DISPLAY, TRIGGER:-PT15M) when the user wants a
        reminder.
      - Change: GET the event, edit it, PUT it back to the same href with
        `-H 'If-Match: <etag>'` so you never overwrite a concurrent edit.
      - Remove: `DELETE` the href with `-H 'If-Match: <etag>'`.
      - Success is HTTP 201/204. 412 means it changed meanwhile: re-read and
        retry. Confirm by reading the range again.

      Before adding, check the range for overlaps and tell the user about
      any. Do not change or delete events the user did not ask about.

      ## Booking requests and bookings (book.lassul.us)

      Events whose UID ends in `@book.lassul.us` come from the booking page.
      It reads them back every minute (for bookings that have not started
      yet) and mails the guest about what changed, so editing them is how
      bookings are managed:

      - Pending request: `STATUS:TENTATIVE`, SUMMARY starts with `? `.
      - Booked: `STATUS:CONFIRMED`.
      - The DESCRIPTION holds the guest (`Name <email>`), their note, and as
        its last line the admin link `https://book.lassul.us/a/<token>`.

      | Calendar edit | Effect, guest mail |
      | --- | --- |
      | DELETE a booked event (or set `STATUS:CANCELLED`) | cancelled, guest gets a cancellation |
      | DELETE a pending request | declined, guest gets a decline |
      | Change DTSTART/DTEND | rescheduled; a booked guest gets the updated invitation |
      | Set a pending request to `STATUS:CONFIRMED` | approved, guest gets the invitation |

      Use If-Match as for your own events. The booking page rewrites SUMMARY
      and DESCRIPTION itself; edits to them are not kept. Act on a booking
      only when the user decided to.

      To send the guest a personal message with the decision, use the admin
      link instead (an optional `message` is mailed along):

      ```sh
      curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST \
        --data-urlencode 'message=Looking forward to it' \
        'https://book.lassul.us/a/<token>/approve'   # or /decline, /cancel
      ```

      A 303 means it worked. `GET` on the admin link shows the request's
      current state. Treat admin links as secrets: never paste one into a
      chat unless the user asks for it.

  # there: massulus.r talks to it directly, and neoprism reverse-proxies it
  # to hermes.lassul.us. This host joins untrusted networks, so binding the
  # mesh address rather than "::" keeps the listener off café wifi even
  # before the packet filter sees it; the public door is nginx on neoprism,
  # which we control.
  #
  # It is resolved at start rather than hardcoded because the address derives
  # from the retiolum key in clan vars, so a regenerated key would otherwise
  # leave the unit bound to a stale literal. It waits because the interface
  # gets its address after network-online, and aiohttp cannot bind an address
  # that does not exist yet. "+" runs it as root: /run is not writable by
  # hermes.
